Footstep Power Generation using Piezoelectric Sensors

This project is aimed at demonstrating an energy-harvesting system that generates power using piezoelectric sensors placed beneath a walking surface. As individuals walk across it, their footsteps generate voltage, which is then measured and analyzed using an Arduino-based system


📘 Project Summary

The aim of this project is to convert mechanical energy from foot pressure into electrical energy using piezoelectric materials. This approach is simple, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. It finds application in public places such as malls, railway stations, and footpaths to harvest energy from pedestrian traffic.

🔬 Working Principle

- When a person steps on the piezo tile, mechanical stress is applied to the sensor.
- The piezoelectric effect generates a voltage.
- This AC voltage is rectified and smoothed using a bridge rectifier and capacitor.
- The Arduino measures the voltage and calculates power using:

  \[
  Power = \frac{V^2}{R}
  \]

- The result is displayed on an LCD and sent to the Serial Monitor.
